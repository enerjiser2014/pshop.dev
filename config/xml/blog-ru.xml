				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Taras Kopchak, Marketing Manager at <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners/management/cart2cart">Cart2Cart</a>, who has some tips to make migrating your online store easy and secure.<br />
<span id="more-21606"></span> </p>
<h2 style="color:#88B854;">1. Find the right time</h2>
<p>Analyze your store statistics and pick the time with the lowest traffic. This will help to avoid revenue loss and possible inconveniences for your customers, especially if you plan to set the store to maintenance mode during the migration procedure. For most stores, traffic usually drops on the weekends and increases in the middle of the week. However, it often depends on the products and services you sell, so be sure to verify this via Google Analytics.</p>
<h2 style="color:#88B854;">2. Make a backup</h2>
<p>Make a backup to ensure your data is safe in case of any unforeseen circumstances. This is especially important if you’re manually migrating a store. However, even if you automate the migration process with services like <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners/management/cart2cart">Cart2Cart</a>, where the data is simply copied and left untouched, it’s still recommended to backup your information before performing any serious manipulations within your online shop. You can either use such tools as phpMyAdmin, a backup option from your hosting provider, or the one integrated into your current store back office. </p>
<h2 style="color:#88B854;">3. Prepare a SEO strategy</h2>
<p>Many stores experience a temporary drop in organic traffic following their migration. This is usually the result of lost meta information and changes in URLs. Prepare your post-migration SEO strategy to minimize these temporary effects. </p>
<p>Even though services like <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners/management/cart2cart">Cart2Cart</a> allow you to migrate SEO URLs within most shopping carts, sometimes keeping your old URLs is simply not possible. If this is the case, we recommended setting redirects from your old store URLs to the new ones, so that users can access your new store using old links effortlessly. In doing so, you create 301 redirects, which will help you to preserve your current search engine rankings. Otherwise, in their next website crawl, Google’s spiders will encounter countless 404 pages leading to a negative traffic. (This issue resolves on its own if left alone; however, by being proactive, you prevent any major dips in your onsite traffic.)</p>
<h2 style="color:#88B854;">4. Enable Maintenance mode</h2>
<p><em>(Recommended but not necessary)</em><br />
To ensure data is transferred accurately without a single hiccup, you’ll most likely want to set your original store to maintenance mode during the migration. By doing so, you’ll ensure nothing impacts the process of data transfer, while letting visitors know you are overhauling your site. However, if using <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners/management/cart2cart">Cart2Cart</a>, there&#8217;s a possibility to keep your store live for customers without being worried anything goes wrong. Since automated migration does not affect the performance of your current store, you may continue running the business without a hiccup throughout whole migration procedure. No downtime! </p>
<h2 style="color:#88B854;">5. Test your shop</h2>
<p>Your newly migrated store will definitely require some fine tuning after the data transfer, so you’ll most likely continue to sell using your old shop for a while. Naturally, in this case you’ll receive new entities after or during the migration, such as new orders or customers. If you used a service like <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners/management/cart2cart">Cart2Cart</a>, you can migrate those entities by using Recent Data Migration additional service that permits to transfer new data added after the initial data transfer only. It costs 50% of a standard migration price and can be launched multiple times whenever needed.</p>
<h2 style="color:#88B854;">Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Shopping cart migration is always a tough challenge that requires a complex and thought-out approach. Even though data the transfer itself can be significantly simplified with the help of automated services as <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners/management/cart2cart">Cart2Cart</a>, re-platforming doesn&#8217;t end with the last entity migrated. The qualitative switch needs to be preceded and followed by select tasks aimed at setting and tuning every detail of your new online store, as it should be. Good luck!</p>
<h2 style="color:#88B854;">eCommerce platform migration estimate</h2>
<p>If you’re ready to start migrating your online store to the latest version of PrestaShop, check out this price estimator. It’s a great tools to help you decide if you’ll migrate manually or with an automated service: </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The answer to today’s question varies. Some people feel that marketplace commissions are prohibitively high. Others have seen their sales greatly increase through marketplaces and wouldn’t dream of going back.</p>
<p>While some professionals and agencies take a stance for or against the use of marketplaces, online communities abstain from making general recommendations because each case differs—and with it the relative merit.<br />
<span id="more-21661"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5a">What about commissions?</h2>
<p>Commissions are what oil the machine. Marketplace commissions can reach levels that may seem scandalously high, but let’s delve further into the question before making a judgement.</p>
<p>Advertising campaigns and price comparison sites rely on the services of true professionals, whose job is to help you reach your targets and achieve a suitable return on your investment. Professional services come at a price. Sellers who do this work themselves often end up operating at a loss.</p>
<p>So you start to ask yourself how you can sell your goods without advancing this kind of money. And that is when you understand that marketplaces are there to cover these costs—but will recover them through commissions.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5a">Is it worth cutting into your profits?</h2>
<p>Once the commission is taken, you sometimes—maybe often—find yourself making zero profit.  You can’t have everything! Sure, you’re just breaking even, but you’re also not spending any money to get to the customer in the first place.</p>
<p>By using a marketplace, you gradually build your portfolio of customers, at no cost. And that is the greatest, even the sole, advantage of using its services.</p>
<p>A marketplace lets you sell your wares without shelling out to bring in customers, and this increases your volumes. That means business growth.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5a">Are customer evaluations a pro or a con?</h2>
<p>Marketplaces assess the overall performance of their sellers and rate them accordingly, relying partly on customer evaluations to do so.  When your ratings soar, your sales follow. So you have to see evaluations as motivators that will help accelerate the growth of your business.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5a">What other benefits can you expect to reap?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve taken the plunge, made your first sales, mastered the routine, and had your first positive feedback, you can move beyond the hypothetical and actually grow your business.</p>
<p>Use the marketplace’s indicators. They are marketing tools to further accelerate your sales. It is in your interest to let customers know that you are an eBay Power Seller or that your average seller rating on Amazon is 4.3/5.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that you are a professional vendor reassures potential customers. They will also understand that they can save money by buying directly from you, on your site.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5a">How do you build customer loyalty?</h2>
<p>Marketplace customers are fickle. Your job is to make sure they remember their purchase.</p>
<p>Parcel preparation is one way to do this: add a “gift voucher” (essentially a discount code) and a branded gift, like a sticker, mouse pad, lighter, or pen). Your choices can reflect the items purchased. You should not provide the URL of your online store if this would violate the terms of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Take full advantage of the parcel as a marketing medium: add your shop logo to the delivery label and paper invoice, and insert a flyer. </p>
<p>The customer loyalty you build on marketplaces will boost your sales on your own site.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5a">The big picture</h2>
<p>By expanding your presence on marketplaces, your sales increase. And you can sell to customers abroad without the need to invest there.</p>
<p>This brings us to the earlier point that growth brings you more customers and builds loyalty, which you may then capitalize on.</p>
<p>To sum up, marketplace sales accelerate your business without risky investments on your part. </p>
<h4 style="color:#251b5a">About Common-Services</h4>
<p>In 2010, I drew on what I had learned as an online merchant between 2005 and 2008 to create Common-Services, which aims to develop simple tools for online sellers. I understood their needs from personal experience, and this helped us develop the right solutions for the most frequent problems. Our product ranges include logistics tools as well as modules for management of marketplace flows, including Amazon Marketplace for PrestaShop.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Open Source is written into the very DNA of PrestaShop: the source code of your favorite e-commerce solution is distributed under the Open Software License (and the Academic Free License), which allows PrestaShop’s source code to be used, modified and shared under defined terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Attorney and computer specialist Lawrence Rosen is the author of the licenses used by PrestaShop. We had the privilege of asking a few questions. Here’s what he had to say&#8230;:<br />
<span id="more-21585"></span><br />
<strong>Considering the number of licenses already available when you created the OSL and AFL licenses, could you give us your rationale for their creation? </strong></p>
<p>I wanted to write a license (OSL) that provided the strength of the GPLv2 with clearer language and a better definition of &#8220;derivative works.&#8221; I also wanted to create an academic license (AFL) with the strength of the Apache License with the exact same language as the OSL. I hoped this would make it easier for the public to understand how open source licenses work.</p>
<p><strong>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Software_License#Key_features" target="_blank">its Wikipedia article</a>, one of the OSL’s most unique characteristics is its patent action termination clause, intended to dissuade users from filing patent infringement lawsuits. Would you say that this is the main interest of using the OSL?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that the patent provisions are unique in effect. During the drafting of the OSL/AFL licenses, there were lots of discussions about how to craft an enforceable and meaningful patent grant and patent termination provision. Now many other open source licenses follow the same OSL/AFL pattern with different lawyer-chosen words.</p>
<p><strong>In <a href="http://rosenlaw.com/OSL3.0-explained.htm">your article about OSL 3.0</a>, <strong>in reference to forcing the disclosure of the source code</strong>, you write that &#8220;This ambiguity of the GPL is eliminated from OSL 3.0&#8243;, which would explain why you see the OSL as superior to the GPL.<br />
Using GPL code makes some developers/companies nervous because of its &#8220;contamination&#8221; effect. Would you say the OSL is less &#8220;contaminating&#8221; than the GPL is?</strong></p>
<p>There is a long-term, widespread community argument about the reach of the GPL licenses to works that are independently written but aggregated (through some form of linking) to GPL code. Words like &#8220;contaminating&#8221; and &#8220;viral&#8221; and &#8220;infectious&#8221; are tossed into those discussions without clear definitions. As a result, some companies remain hesitant about using certain GPL software. That is a shame; much free GPL software is very good.</p>
<p>I hope for a court decision someday that will remove that GPL confusion.</p>
<p>The OSL/AFL licenses intend to eliminate such confusion. These licenses do not affect independently written code at all, no matter how aggregated.</p>
<p><strong>Unlike the OSL license, the AFL license mentions that derivative works can use any other license that does not contradict its terms and conditions. Could you name some of these licenses?</strong></p>
<p>Apache License, GPL licenses, MPL, EPL, etc., etc. The AFL license is very permissive.</p>
<p><strong>A few projects have moved away from OSL in recent years: ClearCanvas <a href="http://clearcanvas.ca/Home/Community/OldForums/tabid/526/aff/8/aft/16278/afv/topic/Default.aspx" target="_blank">moved to the GPL in 2013</a>; CodeIgniter <a href="https://hakre.wordpress.com/2011/10/27/codeigniter-goes-copyleft-with-osl/" target="_blank">moved from a BSD-like license to OSL 3.0 in 2011</a>, then <a href="http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-40.html" target="_blank">switched to MIT in 2014</a>; Mulgara still uses the OSL, but they require new code to be contributed using the Apache 2.0 license <a href="http://code.mulgara.org/projects/mulgara/wiki/License" target="_blank">in order to eventually move to that license</a>; Sparse <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-sparse/msg03322.html" target="_blank">moved to the MIT license in 2013</a>.<br />
While their reasons to move away from OSL are varied, most seem to move away from it in order to have more user contributions. Would you say it is a misunderstanding on their part?</strong></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remotely judge the decisions that open source projects make about licenses. Nor do I feel compelled to push the OSL over other good licenses. I will say that BSD and MIT licenses are weak. They miss many provisions about patents and other important intellectual property issues. Why people keep using those licenses is a mystery. On the other hand, these licenses are compatible with each other for aggregations, so the world will have more open source software regardless of which licenses are chosen.</p>
<p><strong>Drupal uses the GPL, and made it clear that plugins/modules and themes are derivative works of the core software, and that its PHP code must therefore be released under the GPL too (cf. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/licensing/faq/#q7" target="_blank">Drupal policy</a>). Would you say that OSL-using projects should work the same way?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely not. &#8220;Plugins/modules&#8221; and &#8220;themes&#8221; are not proper examples of &#8220;derivative works.&#8221; I am waiting for a court to rule that way someday and quiet this GPL-induced confusion. In the meantime, an OSL project doesn&#8217;t have that problem.</p>
<p><strong>PrestaShop is distributed under the OSL 3.0 license, and chose to have its native modules licensed under the AFL 3.0 (<a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/for_greater_clarity_prestashop_is_updating_its_licenses/">see blogpost</a>). Would you say this is the correct way to go?</strong></p>
<p>That sounds reasonable but I can&#8217;t remotely judge other&#8217;s technical and licensing decisions. It wouldn&#8217;t be fair of me even though I&#8217;m grateful that OSL and AFL were chosen.</p>
<p><strong>The GNU project/FSF has <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#OSL" target="_blank">a critical view of the OSL</a>, writing that &#8220;distributing OSL software on ordinary FTP sites, sending patches to ordinary mailing lists, or storing the software in an ordinary version control system, is arguably a violation of the license&#8221;. How would you respond to such claim?</strong></p>
<p>Copies or derivative works of an OSL work must also be distributed under the OSL. The definition of distribution in the OSL includes the things mentioned by FSF. The strange thing is that the exact same rules would apply to GPL software. What are they complaining about?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UGC can be a real magnet for shoppers on your eCommerce site. There are different ways that you can incorporate UGC on your pages in order to cater to shoppers at different stages of their shopping journey. Let’s have a closer look of how UGC can be incorporated onto your online store.<br />
<span id="more-21566"></span> </p>
<h2 style="color:#e00f2f">1. Use UGC by influencers to create product awareness</h2>
<p>Influencer marketing is gaining traction, as brands and online merchants seek new ways to attract attention to their businesses, using opinion leaders as a proxy for reaching out to new customers. The premise is simple &#8211; identify opinion leaders in your product category, get them to try your products and encourage them to share their experiences with their followers. To complete the circle, bring this content to your eCommerce site to let shoppers discover your products through the stories told by the influencers. </p>
<p>This is exactly the strategy used by The Body Shop UK to increase awareness of its new skincare line, bringing UGC video reviews made by influential beauty bloggers straight to its eCommerce site. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-03-29-at-18.28.33.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-29 at 18.28.33" width="1598" height="1228" class="alignright size-full wp-image-21570" /></p>
<p>This approach works well when introducing new products as well as promoting best-selling staple items. It’s used by both large global brands and small online merchants </p>
<h2 style="color:#e00f2f">2. Use review-type UGC to convert visitors actively looking to buy</h2>
<p>When shoppers are actively weighing in on their options and considering following through on a purchase, the best way to give them a friendly nudge to convert is to provide content that promotes trust and alleviates buyer anxiety. Product reviews produce on average <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/9366-ecommerce-consumer-reviews-why-you-need-them-and-how-to-use-them/" target="_blank">an 18% increase in sales</a> and motivate 63% of shoppers to complete purchases. Paired with visual UGC, they stand as a powerful force to drive conversions on your product pages. </p>
<p>Authentic UGC that showcases how a product has worked for other shoppers can help overcome uncertainty and convince shoppers to buy. Think about adding UGC review videos from YouTube or “before” and “after” photos from Instagram, like Benefit Cosmetics in the example below. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-03-29-at-18.35.06.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-29 at 18.35.06" width="1340" height="1218" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21567" /></p>
<p>You can also think “outside the box” and add unboxing videos or comparison videos made by knowledgeable fans to share truly unbiased views on the product and project your confidence in the product as a merchant. In the example below, European sporting goods merchant Sneaker 10 uses this strategy to helps shoppers visualize their purchases better. This makes the online shopping experience as real as possible, much like in physical retail.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-03-29-at-18.16.26.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-29 at 18.16.26" width="1460" height="1202" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21568" /></p>
<h2 style="color:#e00f2f">3. Use how-to UGC to help shoppers post-purchases</h2>
<p>Truly amazing online shopping experiences take into account not only new visitors, but also those who return to your site for more information after purchasing. UGC can help here as well.</p>
<p>Consumer-made tutorials and demos are very valuable for shoppers, especially when they come in video form. This type of UGC is easy to digest and helps shoppers overcome the fear of using the product incorrectly. Sites like YouTube are overflowing with UGC <a href="http://blog.goodvid.io/how-online-retailers-can-leverage-how-to-video-content/" target="_blank">how-to videos</a>, the demand for which grows <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/i-want-to-do-micro-moments.html" target="_blank">70%</a> year-on-year.</p>
<p>For example, Tassimo UK’s eCommerce site uses UGC how-to demo videos to showcase how to correctly use the brand’s signature coffee machines and how consumers brew their delicious coffee drinks.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-03-29-at-18.22.19.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-29 at 18.22.19" width="1450" height="1230" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21569" /></p>
<p>This type of content serves as a memorable reference point for shoppers, prompting them to return to your site whenever they have questions. </p>
<h4 style="color:#c52d3a">What to keep in mind when using UGC in eCommerce</h4>
<p>Now that we convinced you that user-generated content can help improve customer experience throughout shopping journey, here are some practical tips to have in mind when you decide to bring UGC to your eCommerce pages. </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Encourage shoppers to submit UGC.</strong> While there’s a ton of user-generated content on social media, it’s also important to let shoppers know that you are welcoming their own content submissions on your site. Make it easy and straightforward for customers to share with other their product reviews, photos and videos on your pages. This way you improve customer experience by opening the gates to communication and feedback with your shoppers and by showing a sincere interest in their satisfaction with the products.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t just collect UGC, curate.</strong> With so much abundance of UGC, you might be tempted to channel as much content to your pages as possible. The trick, however, is not only to collect, but also make a hand-picked selection of UGC that appears on your site. You want only the best quality content that is aligned with your brand, in order to make a good impression on your visitors.</li>
<li><strong>Give credit where needed.</strong> Content creators invest time and effort to make those cool user-generates photos and videos you’d like to use on your eCommerce site. So before you jump on the opportunity to add their content, make sure it’s okay with them. Different social media platforms might have different content policies, so just make sure to check your options beforehand.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure content loads quickly and correctly.</strong> When it comes to customer experience in eCommerce, page load time can make or break customer satisfaction. You don’t want to compromise speed and accuracy for the advantage of having UGC on your pages. Make sure content loads fast and is displayed correctly on your site, including the mobile version of your online store.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze what works.</strong> It’s not enough to just bring UGC to your eCommerce pages, you also need to know how it performs over time. Do user-generated videos have higher click-through rates than customer photos from Instagram? Do pages with UGC have higher conversion rates than pages without this content? Run tests and experiments to observe what works best for your site and what kind of UGC generates the best response in terms of engagement and sales for your shoppers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:#e00f2f">Conclusion</h2>
<p>User-generated content can make customer experience on eCommerce sites more authentic, memorable and trustworthy. Share with your customers user-generated photos and videos they’ll enjoy watching and appreciate for helping them stay informed. Try new platforms that can help you streamline the process of discovering, curating, embedding and optimizing UGC on your pages. They’ll help you do UGC right and exceed customer expectations when it comes to online shopping.</p>
